DEPLOYMENT READY - WHAT WAS FIXED
==================================

Your plugin is now ready for Freemius deployment and WordPress.org submission!

WHAT WAS FIXED
==============

1. ✅ Freemius SDK Loading
   - Wrapped all Freemius SDK code in @freemius:premium-start/end tags
   - Added proper file_exists() checks before loading
   - Created free-version stubs that grant full access

2. ✅ Class Structure
   - Conjure_Freemius class has free version (always grants access)
   - Premium version wrapped in Freemius tags (auto-stripped)
   - Conjure_Premium_Features returns proper free-version values

3. ✅ Graceful Degradation
   - All code works without Freemius SDK present
   - No fatal errors when SDK is missing
   - Proper fallback values in all checks

4. ✅ WordPress.org Compliance
   - Free version: 100% GPL, no external API calls
   - No licensing restrictions in free version
   - No upgrade prompts in free version
   - All features available to everyone

5. ✅ Documentation
   - Created FREEMIUS-DEPLOYMENT.txt (deployment guide)
   - Created WORDPRESS-ORG-COMPLIANCE.txt (compliance checklist)
   - Created .freemiusignore (exclude dev files)
   - Updated README.md with deployment info

HOW IT WORKS NOW
================

FREE VERSION (WordPress.org):
- All Freemius SDK code automatically stripped by Freemius
- All core features available (wizard, import, child themes)
- Manual plugin installation required
- No external API calls
- 100% GPL compliant

PREMIUM VERSION (via Freemius):
- Includes Freemius SDK for license management
- AUTOMATIC PLUGIN INSTALLATION (premium feature)
- Advanced theme detection
- Lifetime integration support for theme developers
- All features from free version PLUS automation

NEXT STEPS TO DEPLOY
=====================

1. TEST LOCALLY FIRST
   -------------------
   Simulate free version:
   - Rename vendor/freemius/ to vendor/freemius-disabled/
   - Clear WordPress caches
   - Test all wizard functionality
   - Verify no errors in debug mode
   - Rename back when done

2. PREPARE FOR DEPLOYMENT
   -----------------------
   - Update version number in conjurewp.php (currently 1.0.0)
   - Update CONJUREWP_VERSION constant
   - Commit all changes to git
   - Create git tag: git tag v1.0.0
   - Push tag: git push origin v1.0.0

3. DEPLOY TO FREEMIUS
   --------------------
   OPTION A - Manual Upload:
   - Create plugin ZIP
   - Upload to Freemius dashboard
   - Click "Add New Version"
   - Wait for processing
   - Set status to "Released"

   OPTION B - GitHub Actions (Recommended):
   - Add deploy-on-freemius action to workflow
   - Push git tag (triggers automatic deployment)
   - GitHub uploads to Freemius automatically

4. VERIFY DEPLOYMENT
   ------------------
   - Check Freemius dashboard shows both versions
   - Download FREE version from Freemius
   - Verify vendor/freemius/ is NOT present
   - Test free version on clean WP install
   - Download PREMIUM version
   - Verify vendor/freemius/ IS present
   - Test premium version

5. SUBMIT TO WORDPRESS.ORG (Optional)

   - Create WordPress.org account (if needed)
   - Submit plugin at: https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/add/
   - Include readme.txt (WordPress.org format)
   - Add screenshots to /assets/ folder
   - Wait for review (usually 2-14 days)
