CODE STRUCTURE FOR FREEMIUS COMPATIBILITY
==========================================

The plugin uses Freemius premium tags to separate free and premium code:

FREE VERSION STUBS (Always Present):
------------------------------------
class Conjure_Freemius {
    public static function has_free_access() {
        return true; // Everyone gets full access
    }
    
    public static function is_open_source_theme() {
        return true; // All themes treated as open-source
    }
}

PREMIUM VERSION (Stripped by Freemius):
---------------------------------------
// @freemius:premium-start
class Conjure_Freemius {
    // Advanced license checking
    // Theme detection logic
    // Freemius SDK integration
}
// @freemius:premium-end

This ensures:
- Free version works perfectly without any premium code
