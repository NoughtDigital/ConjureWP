Revolution Slider Demo File
============================

To test Revolution Slider import functionality, you need to:

1. Install and activate Revolution Slider plugin
2. Create a slider in Revolution Slider
3. Export the slider:
   - Go to Revolution Slider admin
   - Select your slider
   - Click "Export Slider"
   - Save the exported file as "slider.zip"
4. Place the slider.zip file in this directory

The slider.zip file should be a complete Revolution Slider export that can be
imported through the ConjureWP import wizard.

Note: Revolution Slider is a premium plugin and is optional for testing.
      The basic ConjureWP functionality works without it.
